b'antibacterial antibiotics are commonly classified based on their mechanism of action, chemical structure, or spectrum of activity. most target bacterial functions or growth processes. those that target the bacterial cell wall (penicillins and cephalosporins) or the cell membrane (polymyxins), or interfere with essential bacterial enzymes (rifamycins, lipiarmycins, quinolones, and sulfonamides) have bactericidal activities. those that target protein synthesis (macrolides, lincosamides and tetracyclines) are usually bacteriostatic (with the exception of bactericidal aminoglycosides). further categorization is based on their target specificity. "narrow-spectrum" antibacterial antibiotics target specific types of bacteria, such as gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria, whereas broad-spectrum antibiotics affect a wide range of bacteria. following a ##-year hiatus in discovering new classes of antibacterial compounds, four new classes of antibacterial antibiotics have been brought into clinical use in the late ####s and early ####s: cyclic lipopeptides (such as daptomycin), glycylcyclines (such as tigecycline), oxazolidinones (such as linezolid), and lipiarmycins (such as fidaxomicin).'

b"john von neumann also consulted for the eniac project. the electronics of the new eniac ran at one-sixth the speed, but this in no way degraded the eniac's performance, since it was still entirely i/o bound. complicated programs could be developed and debugged in days rather than the weeks required for plugboarding the old eniac. some of von neumann's early computer programs have been preserved. the next computer that von neumann designed was the ias machine at the institute for advanced study in princeton, new jersey. he arranged its financing, and the components were designed and built at the rca research laboratory nearby. john von neumann recommended that the ibm ###, nicknamed the defense computer include a magnetic drum. it was a faster version of the ias machine and formed the basis for the commercially successful ibm ###."
